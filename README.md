# Pomodoro-Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

I wrote the webapp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I commented everything in English. The diagrams are in Dutch. I started out in Dutch and when I was coding I decided to change to English because it gave me the oppertunity to ask for more feedback online.
